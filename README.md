# CityPets mobile app

## Requirements  

For building the mobile app we will use *React Native*, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Native framework allows to build native mobile apps, using the same design as React.
We are going to use *Firebase* for the real time database and authentication. 

## Specifications  

CityPets is a **mobile application** that aims to help both pets owners, people who would like to have pets or just animal lovers, build a community in their own city.  
The user needs to first register into the application. After they register, they have to login into the application every time, using the username and password.  

As a user, you have a news feed with all the recents posts and a menu where you can choose to see just what youâ€™re interested in:
- Pets adoption announcements;
- Lost pets announcements;
- Pets found in the streets;
- Pets care announcements.  

Also from the menu, you can add your own posts and choose the category it fits in. You can add your mobile phone/email for contact, pictures, title and a description for the post.
